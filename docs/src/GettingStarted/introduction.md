Welcome to the **Immersive Realities Initiative at Swarthmore**, where we provide access and training in cutting-edge immersive technologies such as virtual reality and augmented reality, empowering students to explore new dimensions and unleash their creative potential. Join us in shaping the future of reality through immersive experiences and interdisciplinary collaboration.

## Mission

In order to give students access to and experience with emerging technologies, specifically Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and 3D modeling - otherwise known as Extended Reality (XR), our mission is to:

1.  Integrate XR into the curriculum in ethical, accessible, and pedagogical sound ways
2.  Support the use of XR to enhance academic research and scholarship across the disciplines
3.  Enhance student engagement in co-curricular events through the use of XR technologies

## More

If you have a course, event, or research project that you feel would benefit from hands-on exposure to immersive technologies, the Digital Scholarship team can create a custom demonstration tailored to your pedagogical or research interests. We support these efforts from brainstorming to assessment, helping you plan, execute, and evaluate the use of these tools in your teaching and research.
